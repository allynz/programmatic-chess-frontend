        You can center a div within a div with Flexbox. Flexbox is a great method since it’s responsive and doesn’t require margin calculations — but there are a few extra steps to keep in mind.

        To center a div horizontally and vertically with Flexbox, you need to set the height of the HTML and body to 100%. You can set the height of the parent container to 100% as well, if you'd like it to take up the whole viewport even if it was resized. For this demo, I'll set the parent container to a specific height instead.

        Additionally, you need to define the parent container as a flex container. You can do this by setting the display property to “flex.” Then define the align-items and justify-content property to “center.” This will tell the browser to center the flex item (the div within the div) vertically and horizontally.

        You can learn more about the layout module Flexbox by reading Here's the Difference Between Flexbox, CSS Grid, & Bootstrap. For now, let’s just look at an example.

        In the example below, we'll center a div with a yellow background color, instead of a border, and no text inside. It will look like a yellow square instead. We'll also add a background color to the parent container so you can more clearly see how the child div element is centered horizontally and vertically.
